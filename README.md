- 👋 Hi, I’m @adv1066-coder
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to Code (Python / JS / Django, etc) in order to undertsand and study ML / AI / Data Science & Deeplearning, Scenario Modelling, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS & Python ...  still in the foothills.  Feeling quite isolated doing this on my own, without SME support.   Continue to persevere. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate as soon as I feel I have the necessary understanding of Algorithms, Coding Syntax & Network analysis 
- 📫 How to reach me:  adv1066@yahoo.co.uk
